# Browser-Based WhatsApp Chat Transcripts (.txt) to PDF Converter

A simple, client-side tool that converts your WhatsApp chat transcripts into a printable (and PDF-friendly) format. This converter not only renders your chats in a clean, easy-to-read layout but also provides filtering options and insightful statistics.

## Key Features

- **Transcript Parsing:**  
  Converts your WhatsApp text transcripts (copied or uploaded) into a formatted chat view.

- **Markdown & Syntax Highlighting:**  
  Utilizes [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) and [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to support Markdown formatting and code block highlighting within messages.

- **Filtering Options:**  
  Easily filter messages by sender and date range to view specific portions of the chat.

- **Chat Statistics:**  
  Automatically generates statistics including:
  - Total number of messages.
  - Message counts per sender.
  - Monthly distribution of messages displayed as a bar chart (using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)).

- **Print to PDF:**  
  Use your browser's print functionality to save the rendered chat transcript (with statistics) as a PDF file.

- **File Upload Support:**  
  In addition to pasting the transcript into the text area, you can also upload a `.txt` file containing your WhatsApp transcript.

   - Click **"Apply Filters"** to update the view accordingly.

5. **View Statistics:**
   - The chat statistics section displays the total number of messages and message breakdown by sender.
   - A bar chart visualizes the number of messages per month.

## Dependencies

This project leverages several popular libraries hosted via CDNs:
- **[Marked](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js):** For Markdown parsing.
- **[Highlight.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.5.0/highlight.min.js):** For code syntax highlighting.
- **[Chart.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js):** For rendering the messages per month chart.

## Customization & Styling

- The project uses custom CSS for layout and styling. You can modify the styles within the `<style>` section of the HTML file to better fit your preferences.
- The printed version hides the controls and only shows the formatted transcript and statistics, ensuring a clean PDF output.

## Notes

- **Client-Side Only:**  
  All processing occurs in your browser. No data is sent to any server, ensuring your chat history remains private.

- **Transcript Format:**  
  The parser expects a format similar to:

  12/31/20, 11:59 PM - John Doe: Happy New Year!

  Additional lines that do not match the initial pattern are appended to the previous message.
